# trading-cli : a bridge between algorithmic and discretionary trading ðŸš€

This project aims to provide an **in-between solution** for traders who want to combine the precision of algorithmic trading with the intuition of discretionary strategies. Itâ€™s designed for those who canâ€™t sit behind their desk all day but still want to execute trades with the timing and precision they need to succeed.

## Why This Bot? ðŸ¤”

Traders often face two key challenges:
1. **Time Constraints**: Itâ€™s impossible to monitor the market 24/7, waiting for the perfect entry point.
2. **Execution Precision**: Without constant attention, itâ€™s hard to capture ideal entries that align with your strategy.

This bot bridges the gap:
- **Algorithmic Assistance**: Automates execution based on predefined strategies and rules.
- **Discretionary Control**: Lets you decide on the strategy, asset, and price level to monitor, ensuring the bot acts exactly how youâ€™d trade manually.

With this tool, you set the strategy and parameters, and the bot handles the execution while you focus on other priorities.
